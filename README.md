# Plimsoll app

The web app and TypeScript SDK for [Plimsoll](https://github.com/plimsoll-protocol/plimsoll-contracts):
see how much of every Stellar-issued asset is backed, who signed the reserve
figure, and how old it is. Issuers and auditors post reports from here;
anyone can list an asset.

**Live:** https://plimsoll-protocol.github.io/plimsoll-app/

| Repo | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [plimsoll-contracts](https://github.com/plimsoll-protocol/plimsoll-contracts) | Rust/Soroban contracts |
| **plimsoll-app** (this repo) | Web app and TypeScript SDK |
| [plimsoll-indexer](https://github.com/plimsoll-protocol/plimsoll-indexer) | Go service: supply poster, event indexer, read API |

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`packages/sdk`](packages/sdk) | `@plimsoll/sdk`: contract reads via RPC simulation, prepared write transactions, indexer client, formatting and hash verification. |
| [`apps/web`](apps/web) | Next.js 16 static export. Dashboard, asset detail, report submission, asset listing, integration guide. |

The web app reads from the Plimsoll indexer when `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL` is
set, and falls back to reading the coverage ledger directly over Soroban RPC.
Because it is a static export, it runs on any static host.

## Pages

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Every listed asset with its coverage ratio, signer tier and report age |
| `/asset/?sac=…` | Reports per tier, supply breakdown, stellar.toml data, and three in-browser checks: live `coverage` call, document hash, breakdown hash |
| `/report/` | Connect Freighter, hash a document locally, sign and post a reserve report. Shows the tier you will get before you sign. |
| `/list/` | List any classic asset; deploys its Stellar Asset Contract first if it has none |
| `/integrate/` | How to call `is_covered` from Rust, TypeScript and the CLI |

## Quick start

Node 22.12 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plimsoll-protocol/plimsoll-app
cd plimsoll-app
npm install
npm run dev        # builds the SDK, then serves http://localhost:3000
```

No `.env` is needed: everything defaults to the testnet deployment. To use an
indexer, copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env.local` and set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL`.

```bash
npm test                         # SDK unit tests
PLIMSOLL_LIVE=1 npm test         # plus reads against the live testnet contracts
npm run build                    # static site in apps/web/out
```

## SDK in 6 lines

```ts
import { PlimsollContracts, TESTNET, Tier, bpsToPercent } from "@plimsoll/sdk";

const plimsoll = new PlimsollContracts(TESTNET);
const cov = await plimsoll.coverage(TESTNET.assets.PUSD.sac, Tier.Transcribed);
console.log(bpsToPercent(cov!.bps)); // "102.00%"
const ok = await plimsoll.isCovered(TESTNET.assets.PUSD.sac, 10_000, 7 * 86_400, Tier.IssuerSigned);
```

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_RPC_URL` | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | Soroban RPC |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | testnet | Network passphrase |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME` | `testnet` | Label shown in the header and wallet checks |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_COVERAGE_LEDGER_ID` | testnet id | coverage-ledger contract |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REPORTER_REGISTRY_ID` | testnet id | reporter-registry contract |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL` | empty | Indexer base URL; empty reads from chain |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ASSETS` | PUSD,USDC SACs | Assets shown when reading from chain |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER_URL` | stellar.expert testnet | Explorer links |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` | empty | Set to `/plimsoll-app` for GitHub Pages |
